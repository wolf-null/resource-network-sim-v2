#### Asynchronous execution problems

##### **PROBLEM: Node process starts before processing of all its neighbors.**

If the net is calculated in parallel, there is possibility, that some nodes will be pushed to exec() with empty input buffer.

As the consequence

1. The problem is semi-fixed a bit via shuffling the exec() order: There is still an average outstripping, but no nodes are prioritized
2. Looks like the problem can't be completely fixed due the essentially asynchronous way of execution
3. Can be fixed by splitting signalling and input processing and synchronizing it. This way is implemented in StageExecSync method (but needs some proper redesign), so to make nodes simultaneously receive, and then, simultaneously receive and process
4. [+] Another way of solution is tracking down how many times Node.exec() of the node is launched with an empty input buffer, and if too many, switch the note to 'idle' state, in which the node receives buffer but sends only zero signals (to wake up neighbor nodes from their possible 'idle' state,  which tells the node that at least one of its neighbors was already calculated)
  1. One can improve this algorithm. by broadcasting TransactionCalculated() or even sending a zero signals to all node's neighbors. When there would be enough of these signals (or the nonzero 'wealth transaction' signals), the node 'wakes up' and sends nonzero signal to the decided node and zero signals to all other 'not-preferred' nodes.
  2. [-] The problem is overloading the input stacks by broadcasting (this also requires additional input processing to count broadcasts)
  3. [-] Since the node is executed much more times than it's really ready to 'wake up', there is a lot of CPU time goes for doing nothing useful, but skipping ordinary exec()
  4. [-] There is some possibility of deadlock                    
    1. [+] Easy to solve by dropping all 'idle' states back to 'normal' at the end of traversing all nodes in its execution thread.
  5. â€‹	[+] But this indeed shall prevent nodes from premature-execution



Found the following solution. Far from being perfect, but still should work out:

1. Execution process is split into two phases:
	1. **Exec**. Income processing and exec()
		1. Collect all *set()* operations from outside of the node and update the inner database
		2. Collects all input signals from the input stack
		3. "The exec() itself" - operate on node's database and prepare all output signals into the output stack.
	2. **Return**. Send all set() operations done at the previous stage to the Host.
		* node-executing process (**NXProc**) requests all those set queries from each of it's nodes
		* NXProc sends those queries to the host-process (**HProc**) which holds the mirror database of all nodes. The latter exists to provide immediate get() operation for the processing stages (which runs separately and independently of NXProcs)
		* NXProc also sends the output signals.
2. At first, NXProc operates the Exec phase for each of it's node (in some order). At last, NXProc operates the Return phase.
3. If this two processes are synchronized for all NXProcs, meaning: at first all Exec of all processes are finished, at last all the Returns are finished, then it's the synchronous execution.
4. If this stages are not synced between processes, then, at least, it is possible to obtain "some level of synchronization" when the nodes gets signals from other NXPs with some delay (dependent on relation between execution speed and a mutual "phase shift")

**PROBLEM: Some colors are used much frequently the the others**

At the moment, the execution thread traverse nodes under its supervision and calls its *exec()* functions. Coloring of the network guarantees that all nodes of the same color can be executed in any order without affecting on each other (straightly). 

But, in practice, some colors are spread a lot whereas some of them is used only by a few nodes.

Applying asynchronous execution leads to 'overactivity' of such nodes of rare color (resources of the PC is divided approximately the same way for all threads).

1. The easiest way of solution is joining some colors together and passing to a common thread (but the nodes in it are executed in a specific sequence).
2. Another way is freezing overactivated threads.
	1. This requires collecting the calculation dynamics.
	2. But also this lets to balance PC's computation resources.
3. The simplest way is setting thread priority based on number of nodes in the thread. Can be done even before the launch, but will fail if the network is heterogenous.
4. Another way of regulation node's activity is bottlenecking the signal transmission mechanisms of such nodes.
